### Appliance 3: Entertainment systems

![Captured power signature 3](src/images/Entertainment.png){ width=65% #fig:signature-3 }

Another very frequently repeated signature is visible in [@fig:signature-3]. It begins with a very sharp rise and ends with a sharp fall. The remainder of the profile is fluctuating by about 0.3A around a roughly constant level which is around 1.1A higher than baseline. The whole pattern takes approximately two hours.

Due to the long duration it is very likely that this is a manually switched appliance. In its on state it uses approximately 1A of power and smoothly fluctuates around this level. This suggests that it is an appliance which has smoothly transitioning, potentially infinite states. This hints at some kind of entertainment electronics or a computer. These kinds of devices display and process different contents which may or may not use more power. However, it is next to impossible to discern a computer, TV, and sound system with the data present.

Regardless, an attempt at verifying the hypothesis will be made. The television set will be turned on for a prolonged time period (in this case for four hours) while there is no other activity on the electricity network. The results can be seen in [@fig:signature-entertainment]. Both the edges and the amplitude match the original signature. The reproduced signature also exhibits the fluctuations. However, without further analysis it is not clear whether this signature would be differentiatable from a personal computer or loudspeakers.
