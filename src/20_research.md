# Existing research

- How to measure electricity
  - Household layout (three phases)
  - Measuring equipment
    - Intrusive load monitoring (in-circuit) e.g. household energy meters
    - Non-intrusive load meters e.g. clamp on or gloves [@monitoringGlove]
      - Allows three phase monitoring, accurate to .2A
      - Allows to monitor building power consumption by access to electricity room (shared in case of apartments) or potentially sewers
  - Sampling
    - Circuit level vs. house level [@circuitLevelMonitoring]
      - Former has advantages like less overshadowing of small devices and potentially room-based classification
    - Device specific features that can improve results by 20-30% [@algoComparison]
      - Transient state signatures (high sampling freq. req.)
      - Steady state signatures
        - Harmonics (FFT on current)
        - Voltage-Current trajectory (2D map)
        - Waveform distortion
        - Active vs. reactive power variation can improve results [@algoComparison] [@inexpensiveClassification]
      - Appliance types
        - Binary
        - Multistate
        - "Infinite" states

- How to identify appliance type and state
  - Generally discerning devices and device states through current [@applianceStateMonitoringMLCoffeeRefrigerator]
    - Single-Phase appliances state identified by ML algorithm
    - Coffee machine making coffee
    - Refrigerator running compressor
  - Use temporal contextual information
    - Harmonics and temporal patterns play a large role [@slidingTimeWindow2] [@circuitLevelMonitoring]
      - Ref Kettle vs. Refrigerator harmonics and power factor ![image](https://www.mdpi.com/energies/energies-07-07041/article_deploy/html/images/energies-07-07041f6-1024.png)
    - +10% recognition [@slidingTimeWindow1]
      - Especially useful for devices that exhibit power spikes and specific patterns
        - Refrigerator / AC
        - Entertainment electronics
    - Two stage approach, identify by using their state transitions instead of current state [@slidingTimeWindow2]
      - Categorise based on harmonics & power factor (linear nonreactive, linear reactive, nonlinear reactive)
      - Identify individual appliances in categories
      - Implementation: Naive Bayes classifier => ~87% accuracy

- Results
  - 97% scenarios, 98.3% on/off events [@inexpensiveClassification]
    - Stove burners
    - Electric kettle (verified by [@listOfDevices1])
    - Oven
    - Toaster
    - Range hood fan (stove fan thingy)
    - Coffee maker
    - Microwave
    - Hair dryer (two modes)
    - Blender
    - Mixer
    - Stereo
    - Refrigerator (verified by [@listOfDevices1])
    - Undetectable/-discernable
      - Lights
      - PC
      - TV (recognized by [@listOfDevices1])
      - Didn't use power factor or harmonics
      - Some devices are hard to discern without detailed knowledge [@listOfDevices1]
  - ~87% accuracy (bayes + temporal two stage) [@slidingTimeWindow2]
  - ~77% accuracy (kNN + bayes) [@moreNumbers]

- Using the data
  - Combining it with external data can yield further insights [@combinedAnalysis]
  - What can be read from it?
    - Discovering large scale trends [@trendsInApplianceUse]
      - 5min sampling, 72 dwellings, 5 sites, 2 years
      - Identified trends in appliance use
        - Increase in standby appliances
        - Appliance category increase (low, high but few medium)
      - Understanding domestic energy usage
    - Habits tracking [@healthCareUse]
      - Managed to identify habits and routines (e.g. using computer while doing laundry)
      - Health/Elderly care use
        - Discovering routines allows recognition of anomalous activities
        - May indicate people not being able to care for themselves anymore
  - Transferring results to offices [@householdOfficeSimilar]
  - Smart meter data is sensitive [@privacyTradeoff]
    - Legitimate interest: Could be used for real-time billing based on e.g. grid-load
    - When sharing it, it is a tradeoff between privacy and data usability
    - Some algorithms exist which may be able to obfuscate data but keep it usable

- Classifying data without prior manual training or knowledge [@unsupervisedClustering]
  - Provides method for unsupervised clustering of appliance features
  - Verified with labelled data
  - Seems promising
